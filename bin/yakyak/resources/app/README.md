## Developing

This is an open source project. Please help us!

It is written in coffeescript (nodejs) based on
[hangupsjs](https://github.com/algesten/hangupsjs) using
[trifl](http://algesten.github.io/trifl/) on top of
[electron (atom shell)](https://github.com/atom/electron).

### Setup

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

### Continuous build

$ gulp watch
```

### Run it

```
$ electron app
```

### Structure

- `src/`: is where sources live
- `src/ui/`: holds renderer code (client side)
- `Yakyak.app/`: is where the app is built
- `Yakyak.app/Contents/Resources/app/`: specifically all is compiled to here
